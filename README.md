# Gate Access System

A web-based visitor entry/exit system for gated premises, developed because walking to the gate every time a visitor shows up is a slow descent into madness. This project includes OTP validation, access logging, and basic UI to replace your building’s deeply trusting and totally ineffective logbook.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone this glorious pile of effort:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/gate-access-system.git
cd gate-access-system
```

2. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```
3. Create a .env file

```
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASS=your_db_password
DB_NAME=gateAccess
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432

SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
```

4. Initialize the database

Inside `/database/`:
```
psql -U your_user -d gateAccess -f schema.sql
psql -U your_user -d gateAccess -f stored_procedures_and_functions.sql
psql -U your_user -d gateAccess -f seed.sql
```

5. Run the server

```
npm run dev
```

### 🤡 Known Issues

- Nobody uses it.
- Authority figures have opinions.
- You might care too much.

### Possible Improvements

- Face recognition (but make it ethical)
- Proper role-based access control
- Visitor QR codes
- Dark mode that actually saves your soul


### 🪦 Final Thoughts

This system was built with love, frustration, and a tragic understanding that the best ideas are sometimes killed by committee. If you’re reading this and actually want to use it—thank you.

If you’re reading this and plan to suggest a “more scalable blockchain-based solution,” please close the tab.
